Given the following dialogue, decide if it is REAL (human) or SYNTHETIC (machine-generated).

A dialogue should be considered REAL (human) only if it demonstrates characteristics such as:
- Sufficient length and depth (not just a short or trivial exchange)
- Natural flow and coherence between turns
- Realistic, contextually appropriate responses
- Evidence of genuine intent, emotion, or subtlety in interaction
- Natural conversational style, including possible hesitations, self-corrections, informal expressions, or filler words (e.g., "um", "well", "you know")
- Absence of obvious artifacts of machine generation (e.g., generic, repetitive, or unnatural phrasing)
- Consistency in persona, style, and topic progression

If the dialogue is too short, lacks depth, lacks natural conversational style, or seems artificial, it should be considered SYNTHETIC.

Reply with a JSON object with two fields:
  - 'output': true for real, false for synthetic
  - 'feedback': a brief justification for your decision
